# Installing LAMMPS

1. Download a tarball from [http://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html](http://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html#tar) by `git`
```bash
git clone git://git.lammps.org/lammps-ro.git mylammps
```
2. Unpack and make following the step 0 in [2. Getting Started â€” LAMMPS documentation](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_start.html#running-lammps)
```bash
make mpi
```
3. Test
```bash
mpirun -np 4 ~/lammps/src/lmp_mpi -in in.lj 
```

Or you can install pre-built binary RPMs(SEE [Pre-built binary RPMs for Fedora/RedHat/CentOS/openSUSE ](http://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html#rpm))

Notes:
1. When you download LAMMPS source files from the SVN or Git repositories, no packages are pre-installed. You can run `make yes-packageName` to install a required package or `make yes-all` to install all packages.
2. `make no-lib` remove the packages than depend on third-party packages

## Missing full atom style 

[LAMMPS / Mailing Lists](https://sourceforge.net/p/lammps/mailman/message/34639586/)
>atom_style full is part of the MOLECULE package, which you didn't install.
when you compile from the git repo, no packages are installed by default.

You can run `/home/coiby/lammps/src/lmp_mpi -h` to get a list of atom styles,
```
* Atom styles:

atomic          body            charge          ellipsoid       hybrid          
line            sphere          tri
```
After you execute `make yes-molecule`, you need to re-run `make mpi`.

## pair_eam_opt.cpp  error

[Re: [lammps-users] Compiling errors - advice needed](http://lammps.sandia.gov/threads/msg48777.html)
>If you read the sections of different accelerator packages under doc/Section_accelerate.html, you will see that several of them (including USER-INTEL) require new compiler flags.  So it is best not to install those packages unless a) you intend to use them, and b) you read the associated doc pages that explain how to build with them.

##  libraries: libimf.so: cannot open shared object file
If you encounter this problem,
>/home/coiby/lammps/src/lmp_mpi: error while loading shared libraries: libimf.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Add library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/icc/composer_xe_2013.3.163/mkl/lib/intel64:/opt/intel/icc/composer_xe_2013.3.163/compiler/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
